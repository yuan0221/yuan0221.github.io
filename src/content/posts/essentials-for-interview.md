# Essentials For Interview

> *Hello Everyone, this is my first english blog. Today I'm here i want to talk about interview. In this weekend，i watched the first part of this [bilibili video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1N24y167f2?p=9&vd_source=efd503d8a8a8fd243454ab62796aaf15) quickly. I wrote down some key points and eager to share with you. I checked this article's grammar by GPT, sorry I am a perfectionist. On the other hand, More important reason is to lear english by write blog。Some of the key points is be worth to think, If you are interested, please continue reading。*

## Requirements
Requirements is a noun. Requirements means you have done da da da several things before you join in a company.If you didn't do or if you don't have this much experience,you cannot work here. These are requirements that a company may have before they hire someone.

For example, When you are interviewing for a front-end development job, maybe a company requires you have two years of experience.This is our requirements，it could be anything，it doesn't have to be experience,it could be for example,some company requires you have a masters degree. That't basically what it means.

## Qualification
What is a qualification and what is the difference between that and requirements?requirements means the company says you must have this,and the qualification just means you have able to do this job.

It't something that a little bit less clear,for a designer,the designer can be design a logo for a company,and the company doesn't say, oh, you must have a degree from an art school.But you have the skill. so you could say,you are qualified to do this job.

## Character
Think quickly about why you have an interview？They've seen your background.you send them things before the interview.They know what job you did before,but they want to know about you.What about your values?What do you care about?What about your behavior? behavior means what your action on a daily? What about your speaking style?All of these things are connected to your Character.

Easily angry or very responsible or maybe friendly,lazy,this kind of thing.this is all part your Character. So when you at an interview, they want to find this out,why?Because you need to be able to fit into this compony.And that's not only about skill,you can be qualified for something and not be hired for a job.You can have all the skills necessary, but they don't want you Because your Character doesn't match.this is a part of meaning of a interview.

# Resume
A document that shows your past, your qualifications, skills, education, work experience. Give this document to the employer. If they think you are qualified for the job, they will decide whether to invite you for an interview. The information in the resume is important. But more important is the format. Whether it is clear and easy to read represents character. If these are not done well, the resume will go to the trash can.

# Confidence
Anyway, I still want to say that due to cultural reasons, there are many people who lack confidence.The author's suggestion is to aim high.Aim high means our goals should be higher rather than lower.If you are qualified for this job, you have the skills necessary to get this job and you really want this job.it's a job you desire. just try,try to get it right. Don't give up before you tried. If you give up before you tried,then of course you'll never get a good job or you'll have hard time getting a good job unless someone you know helps you. But if you try as hard as you can and aim high to get a job, which is maybe very competitive, many other people trying to get the same job, who knows, you might get it by showing confidence.

# Give Clear Examples
Maybe you will say that you are hardworking, passionate, and a good leader.

Give some examples of how hard working you are. Talk about something you did in the past to show that you're hard working. This style is more vivid.

# Avoid misunderstandings
One of the things which can hurt you most when you're answer interview questions. Someone asks you an question, and i'm a little nervous and i'm not sure if i'll be able to understand, but i don't want to make the interviewer think i don't understand the question. I'm going to try to answer the question and actually you answer the wrong question that can really hurt you. If you think you are understand the question, but you're not sure and you try to answer it, actually you answer the wrong question. That's a big big big mistakes. So all you have to do is ask, sorry could you explain that, sorry I don't know what you mean. Or sorry could you repeat that. I did't catch it.

Don't be afraid to ask, don't think of the interviewer will think i'm stupid if i ask. Don't think like this, just ask.

# Avoid Memorization

Another huge thing which can really hurt you in the interview is if you  memorize, memorizing means remembering every word of an answer. 

If the interviewer asks you a question and you memorized every word that you remember. Which is really bad, is that it just makes you sound fake. It reflects something about you character. Most interviewers can feel that this answer is memorized, can see that you're not really there in the conversation. It doesn't feel real. The interviewer will feel a little uncomfortable. They will think this person isn't good at communication because they can't even talk to me. They're memorizing all of their answers. They might as well be talking to a wall. They're not communication with me.

So you should prepare for questions and know kind of what you're going to talk about. Don't memorize the answers. In my opinion, i think this is very important.

# Make The Interviewer remember you

Be interesting in the interview. There is something everybody is unique. 

The interview is not only to see if you are able to do this job, because there might be 10 people are equally qualified to do this job. And what decides which person is chosen. One thing might be your personality fit this team. One thing might be a you're a good leader. One thing might be you're very good at communication. One thing might be you wear genuine, you wear honest. So try to be interesting, don't be boring in the interview, be yourselves, relax.
